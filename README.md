This is my first solo project, to prove that I can turn an idea into a product from scratch.

The basic principle is that the Practice Management Systems that my company integrates with, only have a few reports that are available.

The concept is to design a small tool that allows custom sql to be input, saved, run and returned and maybe (if I can) turn the data into graphs and such.
